Simple picture viewer 

I used AcDsee in the old days, just a simple picture viewer without any bells or whistles.
Today it has become a very large program which is slow with large folders because of the indexing of images.
So I wrote my own program like I remembered from that time.


- Choose a folder to see all images in the folder (now jpg/bmp/tiff, can be easily expanded).
- Double click a folder to enter this folder.
- Double click an image to see it in full screen mode.
- Use the scroll wheel to go to the next/previous image.
- Double click again to leave the full screen mode (or use Escape) and go to the browser again.
- In full screen mode right click the mouse to see the image in actual size.
- If the actual size is shown you can pan the image with the left button and adjust the magnification with the scroll wheel.
- Use the right button again to go to the maximized view and then you can go to the next/previous image.

Still working on it to adjust to my liking, but feel free to adjust it to yours ;-)
